# Code Sample 

This repository contains some of my personal code samples, involving parts of my project and some test projects. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Project Parts Code (Stata)

Here, I provide code segments from a project titled "Replication and Extension of 'The demand for, and impact of, learning HIV status' (Thornton, 2008)", where I was responsible for a specific section.

- **Final Project Yu's Part.do**: This is a Stata code file containing the part I was responsible for in the project. Please note that after downloading the raw files, you might need to adjust the file paths.
- **DA Final Re.dta**: This is a Stata data file corresponding to the above Stata code file. (Provided by Professor, using to run the R file)

## Test Projects (R)

Here's an example of a test project's code. It's a small project done in R, covering some regression analysis and model fitting problems.

- **Final Huang_Yu.R**: This is an R script file containing examples of regression tree, ordinary least squares (OLS), LASSO, and other related model implementations.
- **fmls.rda**: This is an R data file corresponding to the above R script file, containing example data for testing purposes. (Provided by Professor, using to run the R file)
